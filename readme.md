## Project Overview
This project demonstrates cloud-based student grade tracking using MongoDB Atlas with a Node.js/Express.js backend and a React frontend. It showcases the integration of a React frontend with a cloud database to provide functionality for student grade tracking and dynamic dashboards.  

## Key Aggregate Functions Demonstrated:
* **$group**: Grouping grades by category (e.g., subjects, classes)  
* **$sum**: Counting the number of entries per group  
* **$avg**: Calculating the average grade in each group  
* **$sort**: Sorting grades for analysis and display  

## What I Learned
* Implementing **cloud database storage** in a Node.js application  
* Integrating **MongoDB Atlas** for persistent data storage  
* Creating scalable backend endpoints for data aggregation  
* Managing student grade data in a cloud database  
* Building responsive React frontend for data visualization  
* Implementing error handling in data tracking processes  
* Handling data transmission between frontend and backend  
* Creating dynamic dashboards to display aggregated results  

This project demonstrates the practical application of cloud database integration, aggregate functions, and full-stack web development practices in a real-world student grade tracking scenario.
